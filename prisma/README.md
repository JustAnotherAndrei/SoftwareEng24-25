## functionalities

- everyone can track:
  - the money invested for all items
  - the marks left for all items
  - the people involved in the event
- `direct contribution`:
  - these are treated as a unique item for every wishlist
  - received by Planner at `instant`
  - these transactions have a default message (e.g. Mircea transferred 50 bani for your event "x")
- `item contribution`:
  - each such contribution is stored in a buffer and then received by Planner at `fulfill`
  - the fulfilled item transactions must have a unique description (e.g. our contribution to the "red car" you wished for)
  - any money transmitted that has not been used for purchase will be sent as a `direct contribution` to the Planner at the event date
- money withdrawal recomputes the `EventItem::quantityFulfilled`
